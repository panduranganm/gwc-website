      I enjoy listening to music, watching TV shows, and editing photos.
       Continuing with using my summers to explore my different options,
       I decided to join the summer program, Girls Who Code.
       I took a computer course at my school that sparked my interest in coding because I
       thought it was cool to see how I could combine my interest in photography with coding.
       This experience has been one of a kind, and I am so grateful to have met
       all the people from the program</p></div>
