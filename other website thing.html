      <p>My name is Sophia Yoon, and I am a rising senior at Randolph High School. I enjoy listening to music, watching TV shows, and editing photos.
         Continuing with using my summers to explore my different options, I decided to join the summer program, Girls Who Code. I took a computer course at my school that sparked my interest in coding because I
         thought it was cool to see how I could combine my interest in photography with coding. This experience has been one of a kind, and I am so grateful to have met
         all the people from the program</p>
